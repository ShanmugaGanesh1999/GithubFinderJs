# GithubFinderJs
In this project the github profiles and the user details can be viewed by using ajax in javascript and on front end we have bootstrap to view their profile.

This is a project based on GitHub API, with which this program returns all the git hub profiles which are been searched. 

I’ve used bootstrap for front end/visualization part and java script for back end. 

In this page/front end the design consist of a search field and a display section. 

For this process to happen we have to register to our git hub account so that they provide us the key to access their API as json format file. 

In which, the user pass the text, when key down in the search field and this process happens as ajax so that our page doesn’t load for each key pressed. 

After receiving the json, I’ll extract the information needed for the data to be displayed on the page.
